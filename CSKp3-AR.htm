   <p>Ambati Thirupathi Rayudu (born 23 September 1985) is an Indian professional cricketer and current captain of the Andhra team in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy championship. He plays as a right-handed middle-order batsman, who occasionally keeps wicket and bowls right-arm off breaks. He plays for Hyderabad in domestic cricket, and Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Rayudu began his first-class career with Hyderabad in 2002 at the age of 16 and, by the following year, was playing for India A. He captained the India Under-19 team at the 2004 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup and was expected to break into the senior team. Disputes with players and state association, followed by signing up with the "rebel" Indian Cricket League, led to him being ignored for national team selection. He returned to domestic cricket in 2009 by accepting BCCI's amnesty offer and terminating his ICL contract. After strong performances for Baroda in domestic cricket and Mumbai Indians in the IPL, he was named in the Indian squad for the first time in 2012. He eventually made his international debut in July 2013, in an ODI against Zimbabwe.
On 2 July 2019, he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. However, on 29 August 2019, Rayudu said that he was willing to play all formats of cricket again.<br> <br><b> Role:Batter <br> Batting Style:Right Handed <br> Bowling Style:Right Arm <br> Nationality:India</b></p>
